  <head>What Can You Do With XPath?</head>
  <div>
    <p>As long as you know how to navigate the XML tree, you can characterize a document by its structural XML - its elements and attributes - as well as the human-friendly content, such as text values of those elements and attributes.</p>
    <p>With XPath, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>find all values used in an attribute,</li>
      <li>identify all <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>s that appear within <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>,</li>
      <li>return only those elements that meet a certain criteria, such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> only if it has a value of "nope" in <code>@rend</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whereas XML schemas and documentation wikis will tell you how an element or attribute <hi>ought to be</hi> used, XPath can tell you how an element or attribute <hi>is</hi> used. It does not, however, make any judgments about the validity or correctness of its results. This makes it a useful tool for finding examples or errors, especially when used in conjunction with human judgment, XML schemas, documentation, encoding guidelines, and/or regular expressions.</p>
    <p>XPath can be used on either a document-level, or across many texts. Here we only test your XPath against one TEI-encoded document, but you can also define working sets within oXygen's XPath tool. Working sets can encompass multiple directories full of XML documents.</p>

    <p>To set up a working set in oXygen, first we will need to select the document icon in the XPath toolbar: <graphic target="test.png"></graphic></p>
